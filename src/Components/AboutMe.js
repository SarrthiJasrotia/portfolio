    Field of Tech is something I have been interested in since a very young age. I have always found the way technology works fascinating, I still remember taking Rc toys and computers apart and then putting them back together just to see how everything worked when I was younger.
    I spent the last 4-5 years involved with the hardware side of things such as robotics through competing at state and national levels, and industrial machine learning at my career technical school. I decided to pivot to the software development because of the field being more flexible hence giving me more opportunities and a better work-life balance.</div></div>
